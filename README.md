# python-lecture-mobi-17
In this git repo you will find my (inofficial) solutions for the MoBi WS17/18 python lecture. 
While they do work as intended, they do in no way clain to be the most efficient, easiest or most pythonic solutions. In most cases I have tried to write the code on a level that is roughly equal with what you should have learned in the lecture.
Their single use is to give you additional examples on how to solve the lecture's exercises, while also giving an alternative explanation on the most critical parts of the scripts. 
Feel free to send me feedback and to discuss the code, if you have any ideas on how to improve it.

Cheers, A
